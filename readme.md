# CodeHarvest

```Text

CodeHarvest is a command-line tool that allows you to extract and visualize the repository structure, including file content, of any GitHub project.

With this tool, you can conveniently explore and analyze the files and directories within a repository, facilitating the organization of your own codebase.

The structure is saved in a file, preserving indentation and formatting.
